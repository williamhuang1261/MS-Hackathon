3. Thank You Experience
Once the payment has been made,  there is a large (basically full screen but youre not on a new webpage its just to create the experience) card where there is a reveal of a certificate ( a PDF) and it gets “printed” to the screen along side some motivation and fun messaging and shareable icons
For the pdf to be created we need this Process:
1. Website Event: A website event triggers a script on your server. The payment process being started 
2. Data Processing: The script pulls the necessary data from a database: Donor name (or "Anonymous Supporter"), Date of donation, Impact statement: "This certificate recognizes your contribution of $50, which provided *emergency shelter and warm meals for a woman and her child for 2 nights, and one mental health counseling session.*" *whatever the calculated benefit was*, Unique certificate ID number
PDF Population: The script uses a library or API to insert the data into a PDF template programmatically.   These are the different tiers of certificates
   1. Purple: $10-24 - "Supporter Certificate"Navy: $25-99 - "Community Builder Certificate"
   2. Cream:$100-249 - "Safety Champion Certificate"
   3. Gold: $250+ - "Founder's Circle Certificate"
   4. Platinum: $1000+ “Changemaker Certificate
3. Delivery: The server then manages the delivery of the final PDF file. 
Within the card it will also have the following
* Completion progress: "You're 75% to your next certificate level!"
* Streaks: "Donate again within 30 days to maintain your 'Consistent Supporter' status"
* Social share Badge Icon for the respective certificate tier that appears on a card on the website next the pop up for the pdf certificate with automatic share to facebook, instagram , and messages, and download buttons *use placeholders for now but we will design little pngs*
* Download button for the pdf as well
Once they exit the certificate page there will be an animation of a cute house in the dark with a wooden fence in front of it, and the lights in the windows will turn on, the streetlight next to the house will turn on, and flowers will grow on the fence.
